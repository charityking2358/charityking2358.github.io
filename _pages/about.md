Greetings! I am a PhD student in [Societal Computing](https://sc.cs.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by [Prof. Kathleen Carly](http://casos.cs.cmu.edu/bios/carley/carley.html). Our research group supports efforts for the Center for Informed Democracy and Social Cybersecurity ([IDeaS](https://www.cmu.edu/ideas-social-cybersecurity/)) and falls under the Center for Computational Analysis of Social and Organizational Systems ([CASOS](http://casos.cs.cmu.edu)).

My research supports understanding how governments use inauthentic activity specifically on social media platforms. This may include the use of bot networks and socket puppet accounts to shape the information environment toward a specific audience. The content of this activity may include disinformation or propaganda to propagate a certain message. My goal is to increase the transparency around information campaigns that take place on social media, due to the inconsistent approach most platforms have towards labeling state-sponsored activity.
